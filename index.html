				<h2>About Machine Learning</h2>
				
				<p>Many data analysis and classification tasks can be formulated as a machine learning problem: without explicit expert knowledge or manual guidance, artificial neural networks can be trained to map certain inputs (e.g. raw images) to outputs (e.g. probability maps for classes).</p>
				
				<p>This mapping is found by training on a set of exemplary “input-output pairs” — training examples — that that must be provided initially. Once a good mapping has been found, it can be used to make predictions on new data.</p>
